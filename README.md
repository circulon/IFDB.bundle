IFDB.bundle
=============

A Plex metadata agent for scraping information from the Internet Fanedit Database (IFDB).

This is an extensive rewrite based on the original (https://github.com/tomfin46/IFDB.bundle) which no longer works.

A big thanks to ZeroQI for the amazing work on the HAMA.bundle (https://github.com/ZeroQI/Hama.bundle) 
which I used a couyple of common claases from... cheers
